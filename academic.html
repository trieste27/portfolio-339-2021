        <h2>PP 320 Policy Memo 1</h2>
        <p>This assignment was our first attempt at the decision memorandum writing format. We were supposed to write as policy advisors to Mark Schmitt, 
            director of the Political Reform program at New America, to help him identify a subset of fundamental institutional reforms that could profoundly affect how politics and policymaking function in the U.S. today.</p>
        <p>I argue for a dual approach to electoral reform through open, top-four primaries with ranked choice voting. This can restore electoral competition in the U.S. and redistribute the power of the duopoly.

        <h2>PP 320 Policy Memo 2</h2>
        <p>Our second decision memo addressed the ongoing debate regarding school funding reform in Connecticut. Writing from the perspective of an advisor to the Connecticut General Assembly, 
            we were supposed to give input on Michigan's Proposal A, a 1994 funding reform that shifted the base of revenues from local property taxes to state sales taxes.</p>
        <p>I argue for a similar policy change in CT so as to equalize tax revenues and uncouple family background from the quality of available public education. 
            Though it is a major change from the status quo, tax reform is the institutional means for far-reaching change.

        <h2>PP 320 Policy Memo 3</h2>
        <p>My third decision memo is addressed to New York's Climate Action Council, which is tasked with implementing an economy-wide program to meet the stringent emissions reductiosn goals in the CLCPA. I offer two approaches—a market-oriented and a justice-oriented approach—to program design given their respective political feasibility</p>
        <p>I argue for a market-oriented approach via a cap-and-trade program. Using evidence from California's successful implementation and the politics of decisionmaking by an executive agency, 
            it is clear that a flexible market mechanism for curbing greenhouse gas emissions is the most feasible.
