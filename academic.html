        <h2>Decision Memo 3</h2>
        <p id="memo-three">In 2019, New York State passed the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act (CLCPA). This nation-leading legislation established a 22-member Climate Action Council to form a Scoping Plan that achieves the CLCPA's stringent goals for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. 
        </p>
        <p id="memo-three">In this decision memo, I advise the Council to take a market-oriented approach to emissions reduction and build an economy-wide cap-and-trade program in New York State. When considering the actors involved with the implementation of California's cap-and-trade system (running since 2009) and the susceptibility of state-level executive agencies to business interests, it is clear that a flexible market mechanism is the politically feasible policy solution.

        <h2>Decision Memo 1</h2>
        <p id="memo-one"> Writing as a policy advisor to the director of the Political Reform program at New America, I identified fundamental institutional reforms which may profoundly affect how politics and policymaking function in the U.S. today.
        </p>
        <p id="memo-one">In my first attempt at writing in the decision memorandum format, I argue for a dual approach to electoral reform through open, top-four primaries with ranked choice voting. This can restore electoral competition in the U.S. and redistribute the power of the political duopoly.

        <h2>Decision Memo 2</h2>
        <p id="memo-two">This decision memo addresses the ongoing debate regarding school funding reform in Connecticut. Writing from the perspective of an advisor to the Connecticut General Assembly, 
            I was tasked with offering input on Michigan's Proposal A, a 1994 funding reform that shifted the base of revenues from local property taxes to state sales taxes.</p>
        <p id="memo-two">I argue in favor of a similar policy change in CT so as to equalize tax revenues across districts and, ultimately, uncouple family background from access to quality public education. 
            Though it is a major change from the status quo, tax reform is the institutional means for far-reaching change. </p>

        <h2>Op-Ed </h2>
        <p id="op-ed">In this op-ed, I advocate for the use of federal funding for a Universal Eviction Moratorium “Plus.” This policy takes care of low-income renters during the pandemic-induced economic crisis, and addresses the discrimination which historically barred some Americans from the housing market. 
            Further, this policy is an immediate response which satisfies the broader, long-term goals of the Biden Administration. </p>
